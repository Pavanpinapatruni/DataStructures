    "## What is Bubble Sort?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms to understand and implement. It works by repeatedly comparing adjacent elements in the array and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works:\n",
    "1. **Compare adjacent elements**: Start from the first element and compare it with the next element\n",
    "2. **Swap if necessary**: If the first element is greater than the second (for ascending order), swap them\n",
    "3. **Continue through the array**: Move to the next pair and repeat the comparison\n",
    "4. **Complete one pass**: After one complete pass, the largest element \"bubbles up\" to its correct position at the end\n",
    "5. **Repeat**: Continue this process for n-1 passes (where n is the number of elements)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics:\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(n²) in worst and average case, O(n) in best case (when array is already sorted)\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - it sorts in-place\n",
    "- **Stable**: Equal elements maintain their relative order\n",
    "- **In-place**: Requires only a constant amount of additional memory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is it called \"Bubble\" Sort?\n",
    "The name comes from the way smaller elements \"bubble\" to the top (beginning) of the list, while larger elements sink to the bottom (end), similar to how air bubbles rise to the surface in water."
